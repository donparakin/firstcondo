# Performance Audits

The Condominium Act, 1998, requires that the first board of directors
of a new residential condominium, even if it is controlled by the
developer, commission a performance audit to determine whether there
are any deficiencies in the construction of the common elements in
time to submit a claim to
[Tarion Warranty Corporation](http://www.tarion.com/)
(formerly known as the Ontario New Home Warranty Program).

# Our Report
First Condo's <i>Performance Audit</i> complies with the requirements
of both the Condominium Act, 1998 (5c), and the
[Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90o31_e.htm).

In the first stage of the _Performance Audit_ process we will
conduct inspections, investigations and analyses in order
to determine if any deficiencies exist with respect to code violations,
material defects and workmanship.  As part of the investigation,
condominium unit owners will be surveyed about any possible damage to
their units due to any common element defects.

The _Performance Audit Report_ will also contain recommendations
for remediation of documented deficiencies in the common elements.

The second stage of the _Performance Audit_ is carried out closer
to the end of the first year to ensure that all deficiencies identified
in the Performance Audit have been successfully corrected by the
developer and the results are submitted to Tarion.

An optional service to our clients is the second year Performance Audit
which is focused on the second year warranty items which are also
identified by the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act.
