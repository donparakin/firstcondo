# About First Condo Group

With a client base of over 600 condominium corporations, First Condo
Group is one of the largest firms in southern Ontario and specializes
in providing the following professional services to the condominium
industry:

* [Reserve Fund Studies](/ReserveFundStudies)
* [Insurance Appraisals](/InsuranceAppraisals)
* [Performance Audits](/PerformanceAudits)

The First Condo Team is comprised of Certified Reserve Planners and
Insurance Appraisers. First Condo Group has
been providing these services to the Condominium industry since 1977
and we have grown and developed the Functional Reserve Fund Study. The
study explains step by step the various factors culminating in a plan that
is effective and useful to the Condominium managers and owners.

Our Appraisal Services and Reserve Fund Study Services have expanded to
include clients in the Cooperative, Commercial and not-for-profit
industries.

Many firms perform these services as a small part of a much larger
selection of technical services. First Condo Group only
consults on these services so that we remain independent and without
conflict. By focussing on this as our core business, it allows us to
evolve our products and pay close attention to our clients' requirements
at all times.

First Condo Group is fully insured and has aligned itself with some of
the best information services in Canada to service our clients needs.
These services include:

* R.S. Means Construction Publishers
* Marshall Swift / Boeckh Building Valuation Software
* Subscriptions to Economic Outlook data and Market Trend forecasts
  through major financial institutions.

First Condo Group maintains membership in all major Condominium Industry
associations and educational institutes:
