A _Reserve Fund Study_ is a financial document that provides the
basis for the funding of major repairs and replacement of the common
elements and assets of the corporation.

Condominium corporations in Ontario are legally required to set up and
maintain at least one reserve fund. Minimum legal requirements are set
out in Sections 93, 94, and 95 of Ontario's Condominium Act, 1998(5a),
and clauses 27 to 33 of its Regulation 48/01.

requirements and provides condominiums with an effective and realistic

the standard for the Real Estate Institute of Canada's professional
designation of Certified Reserve Planner and is widely recognized as
the most advanced reserve fund planning system in Canada.
