Our founder, Hans J. Moehring, was a visionary who saw the need to
provide a method by which Condominium Corporations could assess and
reserve sufficient money for the future capital expenditures required
to maintain the common elements of the Corporation, preserve asset value
and insure the sustainability of the investment for each owner.

* In 1977, he formed H.J. Moehring Associates and actively began to lobby
  the fledgling condominium industry and helped Corporations understand
  the need for a Reserve Fund Plan. Hans Moehring had developed the
  Functional Reserve Fund Study which brought together a vast knowledge
  of buildings and building systems with the discipline of an accounting
  and investing acumen.

* By 1994, there were many different firms heralding themselves as
  &#8220;Reserve Fund Planners&#8221; and the variety of reports that were
  delivered to the Condominium Industry became a larger and larger issue.
  The Reserve Fund Plan was a requirement that most Condominiums saw as
  necessary but the quality and lack of uniformity was a large enough issue
  that groups such as CCI and ACMO began to add weight to H.J. Moehrings'
  lobby for industry standards for Reserve Fund Studies.

* In 1998, The Ontario &#8220;Condominium Act&#8221; was created to replace
  the old statutes and introduced sweeping changes including reserve fund
  studies as an integral requirement for Condominium Corporations.

* From 1999 to 2001, Hans J. Moehring worked closely as a prime consultant
  with the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations to develop the
  regulations specific to Reserve Fund Studies.

* In 1999, Hans J. Moehring also delivered a proposal to the Real Estate
  Institute of Canada for the creation of a series of courses that would
  allow people to achieve the designation of Certified Reserve Planner
  which is recognized under the Condominium Act as a person allowed to
  perform Reserve Fund Studies.
