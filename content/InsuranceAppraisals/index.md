# Insurance Appraisals

The requirement for _Insurance Appraisals_ is set out in the
Condominium Act, 1998(5b), and in each Condominium Corporation's
Declaration. The Declaration typically states the frequency of repeating
_Insurance Appraisals_ and specifies that it must be completed by an
independent insurance appraiser. To be in compliance with the declaration
it is important that the appraisal is not completed by your insurance
company representatives.

First Condo's _Insurance Appraisals_ comply with all legal
requirements and are recognized by major insurance providers.

First Condo's _Insurance Appraisals_ estimate the cost of replacing
the Corporation's buildings and site improvements with new structures,
buildings and facilities of similar design, quality, material,
workmanship and utility.

The final replacement cost estimate includes construction cost,
demolition and disposal costs, material dumping fees, and applicable
taxes.  There are no deductions for depreciation.

# Insurance Appraisal Updates

First Condo also provides annual update services to keep a comprehensive
insurance appraisal current for more than one year. This is a cost
effective way for corporations to ensure that they maintain adequate
insurance coverage given the volatility of construction costs in recent
years.

First Condo will advise each client corporation on the most effective
insurance appraisal schedule.  First Condo clients may also request
reminders for their insurance appraisal updates.  These update reminders
are free of charge.
